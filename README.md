## Introduction
This project is partial implementation for a scanner program (second phase of compiler program), also known as lexical analysis. It has two main purposes:
1. tokenizing ==> reading the text and return the different tokens inside it.
2. Cross referencing(xref) ==> listing every file name and line number an identifier occurs within the program.
